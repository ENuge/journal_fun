# journal fun!
Having some fun with my own ramblings (ramblings not included!)

## Background
For years I've kept a journal of my thoughts, emotions, and ideas for the future. It's been most useful to me as a reference point. When goings get rough, I can find consolation and stay grounded in my younger self's pains and elations. 

But really, most of it is quotes from books and articles I found striking, and vocabulary from said reading (I like to write down every word I can't define or give a synonym for, even if I have a fuzzy understanding of its meaning. I find etymology interesting). The quotes are fairly structured:

"This is a typical quote."
- pg. 58, A Quote of Two Quoties, by Charles Quotens

As is the vocab:
vocabulary - the words that make up a language

So, what can I do with that? 

## Some ideas:
### Quote bank:
	- Mine my journal for quotes of things
	- Create a webpage with UI for viewing/clicking through each, can give each book/article a pretty picture
### Learn my vocabulary:
	- Mine my journal for new vocabulary
	- Create JSON (or whatever importable form my flash cards app uses), import it into that
	- tab-delimited term\tdefinition for each card (newline separates cards)
